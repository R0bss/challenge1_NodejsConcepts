# ðŸ’» Sobre o desafio


In this challenge, I must create an application to train what I learned from node.js!

This is an application to manage tasks. It will be allowed to create allowed to create user with `name` and `username`, in addition to doing the CRUD.

- [ ] Create a new *todo*; </br>
- [ ] List all *todos*; </br>
- [ ] Toggle the `title` and `deadline` of an existing whole; </br>
- [ ] Mark a *todo* how finished; </br>
- [ ] Delete a *todo*; </br>


All this for each specific user (the `username` will be passed by the header). Next, we will see in more detail what and how it need to be done ðŸš€
